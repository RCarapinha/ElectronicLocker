# Electronic Locker

Project done in Digital Systems Laboratory in 1st year of Masters.

# Description

For this project it is intended to simulate an electronic lock. For this we will have a supervisor (that sets the password) and a user (that enters the password).

For this the supervisor will have to define a password. Then the user will have to enter it in order to have access to something, in order to work as an electronic lock.

Through the buttons available in the infrared remote control, the user must enter the password, shown through the hexadecimal displays. If the user makes a mistake in the password, the time until the system allows the password to be entered again increases. If after 10 attempts the user does not hit the password the system is locked until a supervision code is entered.

The user will have access to the information through the hexadecimal display in order to obtain the number of remaining attempts and the time remaining until a new one is allowed to be entered try.
